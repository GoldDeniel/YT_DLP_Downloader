<h1>Usage:</h1>

<h2>List:</h2>
$ python downloader.py list

 - It uses the list.txt file that's in the same folder with downloader.py
 
 <h2>Single link:</h2>

$ python downloader.py https://youtube.com/watch...

- It can also download entire playlists thanks to yt_dlp. (https://youtube.com/playlist)

 <h2>No args (Editor):</h2>

$ python downloader

- Works the same, but it asks for input, you don't need args.
